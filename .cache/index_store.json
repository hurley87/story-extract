no!No.No, no, no.No!Oh!Shrek grabs a chain that's connected to the chandelier and swings \n               toward the dragon.He misses and he swings back again.He looks \n               up and spots that the chandelier is right above the dragons head.He pulls on the chain and it releases and he falls down and bumps \n               Donkey out of the way right as the dragon is about to kiss him.Instead the dragon kisses Shreks' butt.She opens her eyes and \n               roars.Shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto \n               her head, but it's too big and it goes over her head and forms \n               a sort of collar for her.She roars again and Shrek and Donkey \n               take off running.Very 'Matrix' style.Shrek grabs Donkey and \n               then grabs Princess Fiona as he runs past her.DONKEY\n                         Hi, Princess!FIONA\n                         It talks!SHREK\n                         Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's \n                         the trick.They all start screaming as the dragon gains on them.Shrek spots \n               a descending slide and jumps on.But unfortunately there is a \n               crack in the stone and it hits Shrek right in the groin.His \n               eyes cross and as he reaches the bottom of the slide he stumbles \n               off and walks lightly.SHREK\n                         Oh!Shrek gets them close to the exit and sets down Donkey and Fiona.SHREK\n                         Okay, you two, heard for the exit!I'll \n                         take care of the

my tail!That's my personal tail.You're \n                         gonna tear it off.I don't give permission \n                         - - What are you gonna do with that?Hey, now.No way.No!No!No, no!No.No, no, no.No!Oh!Shrek grabs a chain that's connected to the chandelier and swings \n               toward the dragon.He misses and he swings back again.He looks \n               up and spots that the chandelier is right above the dragons head.He pulls on the chain and it releases and he falls down and bumps \n               Donkey out of the way right as the dragon is about to kiss him.Instead the dragon kisses Shreks' butt.She opens her eyes and \n               roars.Shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto \n               her head, but it's too big and it goes over her head and forms \n               a sort of collar for her.She roars again and Shrek and Donkey \n               take off running.Very 'Matrix' style.Shrek grabs Donkey and \n               then grabs Princess Fiona as he runs past her.DONKEY\n                         Hi, Princess!FIONA\n                         It talks!SHREK\n                         Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's \n                         the trick.They all start screaming as the dragon gains on them.Shrek spots \n               a descending slide and jumps on.But unfortunately there is a \n               crack in the stone and it hits Shrek right in the groin.His \n               eyes cross and as he reaches the bottom of the slide he stumbles \n               off and walks lightly.SHREK\n                         Oh!Shrek gets them close to the exit and sets down Donkey and Fiona.SHREK\n                         Okay, you two, heard for the exit!I'll \n                         take care of the

side table.She then lays back down and appears to be asleep.Shrek turns and goes over to her.He looks down at Fiona for \n               a moment and she puckers her lips.Shrek takes her by the shoulders \n               and shakes her away.FIONA\n                         Oh!Oh!SHREK\n                         Wake up!FIONA\n                         What?SHREK\n                         Are

Mm-hmm.Shrek breaks the lock on her door and pulls her out and down \n               the hallway.FIONA\n                         But we have to savor this moment!You \n                         could

my tail!That's my personal tail.You're \n                         gonna tear it off.I don't give permission \n                         - - What are you gonna do with that?Hey, now.No way.No!No!No, no!No.No, no, no.No!Oh!Shrek grabs a chain that's connected to the chandelier and swings \n               toward the dragon.He misses and he swings back again.He looks \n               up and spots that the chandelier is right above the dragons head.He pulls on the chain and it releases and he falls down and bumps \n               Donkey out of the way right as the dragon is about to kiss him.Instead the dragon kisses Shreks' butt.She opens her eyes and \n               roars.Shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto \n               her head, but it's too big and it goes over her head and forms \n               a sort of collar for her.She roars again and Shrek and Donkey \n               take off running.Very 'Matrix' style.Shrek grabs Donkey and \n               then grabs Princess Fiona as he runs past her.DONKEY\n                         Hi, Princess!FIONA\n                         It talks!SHREK\n                         Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's \n                         the trick.They all start screaming as the dragon gains on them.Shrek spots \n               a descending slide and jumps on.But unfortunately there is a \n               crack in the stone and it hits Shrek right in the groin.His \n               eyes cross and as he reaches the bottom of the slide he stumbles \n               off and walks lightly.SHREK\n                         Oh!Shrek gets them close to the exit and sets down Donkey and Fiona.SHREK\n                         Okay, you two, heard for the exit!I'll \n                         take care of the
